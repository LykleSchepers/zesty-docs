Assembling the Pump House
=======================
The Pump House holds the pump, radiator, fan and all the connectors needed to run the system. Optionally you can install a temperature sensor in the water system and mount the display on the house.

Take the base and mount the pump, making sure the drip tray is between the base and the pump. The pump comes with all the screws needed.
Cut off a 30 mm piece of 10 mm hose. (outside diameter)
Slide to hose clips to the middle of the hose.
Slide the hose over the input pipe of the pump and clamp with a hose clip.
Slide the other end over the bottom output pipe of the radiator and clamp with a hose clip. 
Mount the radiator and fan on the base and fix using the four longer screws.
Cut a 5 cm long piece of 10 mm hose. Slide a hose clip over each end. 
Instert a hose reducer in one end and secure with a hose clip.
Slide the other end over the Radiator inlet pipe and secure with a clip.
Insert the two reducers into the front panel till they click. 
Place the front panel in position and fit the cover over the whole unit, while routing the wires out the back, through the cover. 
Hold it all in position while you screw in the 4 base screws with the rubber feet.
