Parts are: Housing, Breech, Hob, Gear, Worm, Clip, Sleeve clamp and Drive cable.

Overall assembly steps
----------------------

Overall steps
* Assemble the Nimble.
* Fix the mount onto the printer.
* Attach the hot-end.
* Insert PTFE and slice to length.
* Mount Nimble on top.
* Mount stepper bracket and connect drive cable.
* Insert drive cable in Nimble and done!

.. Note:: Installing a Sidewinder is mostly the same as for the regular Nimble. Only the assembly of the Sidewinder is different. 

Assemble the Nimble
===================

Step 1
------
Assemble gear and hob
Image: N01.Gear_Assembly.svg
Slide the hob into the gear.
Slide the bearings on both ends of the gear and hob.

Step 2
------
Insert worm bearing in two halves
N03.Worm_Bearing.svg
* You will use the Worm bearings (part P) and both the shell housings (parts A and B)
* Insert one bearing into each of the shell housing.
* This can require a little force. If you cannot get it right, you can use the Worm (part G) to push the bearings in properly. 
* Do this for both the bottom and the top shell.

Step 3
------
Bottom half and gear

Step 4
------
Insert Worm

Step 5
------
Place Top Half (and make sure it clicks)

Nimble is assembled, you can now install the Mount on your printer.

Assemble the Nimble Sidewinder
===================

Step 1
------
Assemble gear and hob

Step 2
------
Insert the bearing in the Sidewinder Top half
Insert the other bearing in the Worm Housing.

Step 3
------
Bottom half and gear

Step 4
------
Place Top Half (and make sure it clicks)

Step 5
------
Insert the worm in the Top housing.
Place the Worm lid over the Worm and click into place.

Nimble Sidewinder is now assembled.

Attach the mount on the printer
===============================

Each printer is different so the actual parts will vary, but overall the steps are the same. 

Attach the Mount
----------------
Image: Mount on CR-10
Make sure that you install all the nuts and or inserts needed in the Mount before attaching it. 
Screw the Mount down onto the printer. 
For Cartesian and CoreXY printers this is usually done by attaching the Mount to the x carraige.
With Delta printers this is done by attaching the Mount to the effector plate.

Fix the Hot-end
---------------
Image: V6 Mount on CR-10
Usually at this stage you attach the hot-end to the Mount. 
Some hot-end you simply screw the hot-end to the Mount, and others, like the E3D V6 you place the groove mount in the right groove on the Mount and attach a clamp to hold it in place. 
Install any fans and/or part cooling fans you need to use on this Mount.


Insert the PTFE
---------------

Every hot-end needs a PTFE tube down the inside. With the Nimble there is no need to clamp the PTFE tube, the Nimble locks it into place. So any bowden connector or PTFE clamp is not needed. 
Slide the PTFE tube into the hot-end making sure it goes as deep as it can go. 
Slide the Clip over the PTFE tube in the correct orientation and slide it down onto the Mount. 
Image: Show Clip in the correct orientation.
Slice the PTFE tube flush with the Clip.
We use the Clip in this way to make sure you get the right length of PTFE tube.
You are now ready to install the Nimble.

Installing the Nimble
=====================
Place a piece of filament in the hot-end.
Place the Nimble in the correct orientation over the Mount and the Clip. 
Push down and the Clip will click into a groove in the Nimble. 
Take the Breech and click it closed, clamping the filament.
(This centers the Nimble over the hot-end)
Use the 3 M3x30 screws to attach the Nimble to the Mount.
Do not overtighten. Finger tight and an extra quarter turn are more than enough.
You have now installed the Nimble and can install the stepper side.

Installing Stepper side
=======================
Image: Exploded view of the stepper, Bracket, Coupler etc.
Overall the steps are to install the Bracket, install the Coupler, slide the drive cable in and tighten everything down.

Installing the stepper Bracket
------------------------------
Undo the screws that hold the stepper.
Place the Bracket on top of the stepper. 
In most cases you need to keep the plate the stepper was originally attached to, and keep that plate between the stepper and the new Bracket.

Use the M3x10 screws to attach the Bracket to the stepper.

Install the Coupler
-------------------
Image: Coupler over shaft
Slide the Coupler down through the top hole in the Bracket and slide it over the stepper shaft. 
place a short piece of filament between Bracket and Coupler to keep the Coupler from touching the stepper.
Tighten the bottom two set screws in the Coupler.

Installing the Drive cable
--------------------------
Image: Sleeve clamp over Bracket
Insert the Sleeve clamp (Stepper side) into the Bracket and rotate clockwise until it clicks. The little tab should now cover the small hole in the Bracket.
Slide the Drive cable throught the Sleeve clamp into the Coupler and make sure the drive cable goes all the way in until it touches the stepper shaft. 
Pull the Drive cable 1 mm up, so it no longer touches the stepper shaft.
Image: Coupler with numbered set screws
Tighten the 4 set screws in the Coupler in the following manner. Tighten one middle set screw (1) till it just touches the Drive cable. Tighten the other middle set screw (2) until it touches the Drive cable. 
Go up and tighten the top set screw (3) until it touches the Drive cable. 
Switch to the other side and tighten that set screw (4) until it is tight. Then go around all the other set screws again to tighten them properly. 
Slide the Sleeve down into the Sleeve clamp (Stepper side) and make sure it is seated properly at the bottom. 
Tighten clamping screw on the Sleeve clamp.

You have now installed the Drive cable and can insert it into the Nimble.

Installing drive cable in Nimble
--------------------------------
Image: Sleeve clamp in place
Place the Sleeve clamp (Nimble Side) in the Nimble and rotate clockwise until it locks. The best position is where the tab with the clamping screw points backwards. 
Slide the Drive cable into the square hole in the worm. This is a tight fit. Make sure the orientation of the square end of the drive cable is the same as that of the worm. If not, rotate the coupler until it is.
Slide the Sleeve into the Sleeve clamp and make sure it is seated properly.
.. Note:: You can define the way the Drive cable arches over the printer by rotating the Sleeve before clamping it. 
Tighten clamping screw on the Sleeve clamp.

The Nimble is now ready for calibration.
